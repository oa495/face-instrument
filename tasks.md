## now
- [ ] normalize distances to work at any camera distance
- [ ] can download as .webm file
* [ ] record sounds with .webm
- [ ] stabilization period
- [ ] pick watch / restart method for notifying on file changes?
- [ ] implement controls for the different instruments
- [ ] add slider instrument that maps to distortion. (perhaps eyebrows to mouth)

## later
- [ ] visualizer
- [ ] visuals / style the page

- [ ] sequencer (?) e.g from the pose thing
- [ ] slider controls distortion
- [ ] angle of eyes / face controls a slider
- [ ] quantize notes to have different rhythms
* [ ] investigate chords (based on emotion or face arrangement)
* [ ] melody vs chord mode


## done-ish
- [X] increase size of video
- [X] update minimum values for face toggle
- [X] different sounds for different parts of the face, make a set of notes that sound good together
- [X] whole face movement controls the octave of the instruments
- [X] implement face sliders
- [X] base sound (accompaniment, beat, etc)
- [X] distance gives volume
- [X] stabilization period
- [X] refactor the files so script.js isn't one large file, add video.js, face.js, etc
- [X] implement meters for the different instruments
